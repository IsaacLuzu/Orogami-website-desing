<hr> 

<p> This is Paulo Luzuriaga im in the 8th grade and this is the first time I've tried creating a website.
    <br>
    Ive made some small simple games in p5 and code.org like the T-rex game and biker race game.
    <br>
    I started learning coding around the middle of 2020 when my oldest brother signed me into WhitehatJr classes.
    <br>
    At first i made games with simple lines of code like "creeateSprite" in p5 and code.org but later I started to use Visual Studio which used different lines of code compared to p5 and code.org.
    <br>
    After learning how Visual Studio worked I started to learn how to make classes for each object i need to make, after a few days of praticing to make classes i started to make more games on Visual Studio.
    <br>
    And after making multiple games with Visual Studio i started to learn how the lines of code needed to make a website worked.
    <br>
    So after a class on how the code for a website worked i moved on to were I am now, making a website for the first time.
</p>
